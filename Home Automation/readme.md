This project is about Home Automation in which we are going to save energy with the help of electronic sensors and actuators.
	As we know in day to day life due to human interference sometimes we forgot to switch off electrical appliance and large power gets wasted as well as there can be chances of accidents.
So that to avoid such circumstanceâ€™s we implemented this project here, we are going to sense the passage of a person into the room using IR & photodiode and then it gets counted in controller by using that data, power will be fed to the appliances.
Here, we have used LDR to sense the light intensity at any instant and according to intensity light in room is adjusted.
